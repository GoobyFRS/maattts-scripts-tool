# maattts-scripts-tool
Welcome to Maattt's Bulk Scripts and Tools repo. 

<h3>What is this repo?</h3>
This repo is a place for me to store things I am working on for my homelab. I also sometimes practice python here. That means that it is not really a single project like most folks. Which makes this look quite a barren place, and well.... It is. Ya see, I cannot share my python projects from work where I have a bunch of small useful scripts I use for my role almost every day. I also severely lack any creativity so creating scripts and tools for personal use is a huge struggle for me.

<h3>maattts-pihole-whitelist.txt</h3>
This is a copy-pastable list of pihole commands to whitelist specific domains to resolve a wide-array of issues I had with my rather aggressive Pi-Hole blocking. Most of these domains I actually learned about from the Pi-Hole forums, some I found on my own. 

<h3>maattts-pihole-blacklist.txt</h3>
Currently this is just a placeholder file. I hope to discover some domains to add to this list that could benefit others in the future.
