# maattts-scripts-tool
Welcome to Maattt's Bulk Scripts and Tools repo. 

<h3>What is this repo?</h3>
This repo is a place for me to store things I am working on for my homelab. I also sometimes practice python here.

<h3>common-whitelist-adder.py</h3>
Run this script on a Pi-Hole server to add all the Common Whitelist Domains from the Pi-Hole Forums!

<h3>common-blacklist-adder.py</h3>
Run this script on a Pi-Hole server to add all the Common Blacklist Domains from the Pi-Hole Forums!

<h3>matts-curated-whitelist.py</h3>
Run this script on a Pi-Hole server to add my personal list of curated domains to your whitelist. This is really just meant for personal use.

<h3>matts-curated-blacklist.py</h3>
Run this script on a Pi-Hole server to add my personal list of curated domains to your blacklist. This is really just meant for personal use.

<h4>matts-txt-blacklist.txt</h4>
Use this as an Ad-List in your Pi-Hole, instead of my script. More likely to be maintained!
